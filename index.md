I’m a beginner and bought the latest Breier 450BH3SG through Mr.YANG Wenjie, the Chinese brand agent
here is the bill.

### After 5 uses only!!!!!

It’s just normal use. Both fins are broken. I’m not the only one in this situation. To understand that other people are also damaged in varying degrees.

### UHW race

Before the race, I was told to use shoe glue to try and fix it

## After sale claim

### Can’t return it,  Just to fix it
Breier fins used to be one of the best fins in underwater hockey. The older models are favored by many athletes and fans.

Unfortunately, the new fins are a real disappointment. Because you’d never guess that the fins only last five tries and then die.

I believe that this is a very obvious product quality problem, as consumers should be given the right to protect.

### Repair Not Rebuilt
Mr. Yang, the China agent, told me that Breier was impossible to return and had never done so. Only glue can be used for repair treatment (the time required for repair is uncertain) . Or send that fins back to the French factory headquarters, have the factory repair me, and pay the high cost of international express delivery (China to France, France to China)

Personally, I think this is obviously a matter of product design and quality. You Can’t fix it by fixing it. It should be disassembled and rebuilt by the manufacturer to solve the problem.

Otherwise, soon after the repair will also appear in the case of damage, not guaranteed.

### This time the Breier flippers really broke my heart.
